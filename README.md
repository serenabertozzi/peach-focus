# Peach Focus üçë

I use the pomodoro timer all the time, so I decided to create my own in React.

## Built with:

- [react-helmet-async](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-helmet-async)
- [HeroIcons](https://heroicons.com/)
- [react-howler](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-howler)

## To-do:

- I want to add sounds and alarms, when the timer stops;
- Add a to-do list maybe? For taks;

# Live version:

- [üçë Peach Focus](https://serenabertozzi.github.io/peach-focus/)
