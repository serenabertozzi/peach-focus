# Peach Focus üçë 

I use the pomodoro timer all the time, so I decided to create my own in React.

## Built with:

- [react-helmet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-helmet)
- [HeroIcons](https://heroicons.com/)


## To-do:
- I want to add sounds and alarms, when the timer stops;
- Add a to-do list maybe? For taks;

# Live version:
